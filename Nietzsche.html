    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (15 October 1844 – 25 August 1900)</strong> was a German <i>philosopher,culturalcritic and philologist</i> whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history. He began his career as a
        classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest person ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.
        <br/>Nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. In 1889, at age 45, he suffered a collapse and afterward a complete loss of his mental faculties,
        with paralysis and probably vascular dementia.
        <br/> He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche. Nietzsche died in 1900, after many strokes and pneumonia.
